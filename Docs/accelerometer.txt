We have:
z = estimated velocity
g = gravity
t = expected direction of travel

We need:
- orientation of gravity
- actual velocity

How are we gonna do this? Heck if I know.
What I *will* say is this. We should *only* expect movement in the X and Z axises.
If there's movement elsewhere, you're tilted sideways or being shoved. Let's
assume the more likely.

So effectively that reduces us to two axises. This actually makes things a little
bit easier, beleive it or not.

The normal gravitaional rate can be modeled as a circle with radius g.
If the accelerometer reads something on circle G, then you must not be
accelerating. The angle of the point, then, is your tilt.

Things get cranked up to eleventy-seven when you're moving. Then your circle
is bigger, or perhaps smaller in the case of deacceleration. Which angle are
you going at now?

Let's get even funkier. The gravitational circle still exists, of course.
Now, if you can estimate your velocity from something else, you can call that
a second circle on the gravitational circle. Where the circle and the point
intersect might be your angle.

The problem with this is that we can only get incline or acceleration from this.
We could get incline if we tilt the gyro so it faces up-down. So, whatev, that's
fine.

Say we have a semi-okayish idea of orientation.
